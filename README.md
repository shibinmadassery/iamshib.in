Hello, I'm Shibin!

I'm currently a Senior QA Tester in the IT industry. My interests range from new and emerging technology, to security, AI, finance, programming, computers and anything else I can get my hands on. My favorite part about testing is being able to find the correct problem and see how it affects our daily lives. 

When theres not nothing I love more than playing music and making movies. Also an avid photographer, reader and nature lover
